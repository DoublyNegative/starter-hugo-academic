Hi! I'm Calvin, a physicist currently studying at the University of Cambridge.

This website aims to serve two purposes. Primarily, it's to provide a platform for me to discuss current projects and ideas - in particular, those which I lack the time to follow-up alongside my degree. Secondly, although this isn't its primary purpose, it *will* probably be used at some point in the future as a place for me to show-off and look fancy for a CV. Because, yes, I'm na√Øve enough to believe that a default webpage has any hope of looking fancy.
